Sometimes for the pie chart, the risk percentage is so small that the text is unable to fit into it. So as a way to let users
know the risk percentage when it is like that, I gave the users an alert which states the risk percentage. Also for the <1 and >30,
I used the values 0.99 and 30.1. I also only used the drop-down list control because i felt like it was the most efficient way
of getting the data from the user without causing any confusion or errors. Also because the drop-down list has all the options
that was in the scoring part of the risk calculator page.
